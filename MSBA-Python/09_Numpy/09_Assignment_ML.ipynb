    "There are a variety of model to use with machine learning. First up, we'll use a tool called decision tree which has \"leaves\" and \"nodes\". Basically, it splits data at key parts (nodes) based on an attribute (leaf) and then goes further and further down the branch. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, at some point, the leaves can be so small that the predictions match the actual values. This is called \"overfitting\" because the predictions overfit for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, we can divide on just a few leaves and what happens is that the model fails to capture important distinctions or patterns in the data. It will perform poorly on training data and is called \"underfitting\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Knowing how to fine tune all this is where the art of machine learning comes in using your data and what you have at hand (called \"features\" or \"feature engineering\"). The science of evaluating your model comes in with using statistical analysis. There's always a tension here.\n",
